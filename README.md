# simple-google
Scrapes Google and creates a list of links for a search term

To run download `main.js`
and run `node main.js`

It will prompt you for a search and will then go to google, get all the links and then put them into the terminal.

Uses Puppeteer so you will have to download that

`!exit` to exit

Currently this is just a prototype improvements may or may not be coming in the future.
